# Fix saving game settings in COM3D2

By default, COM3D2 (1.33.1) saves your settings only when you close the game.  
Because of that, it's really easy to get yor game settings reset if the game happens to crash or if you close it unconventionally.

This simply does not make sense, as many other games save the settings *when you close the settings menu*.

This Sybaris patcher fixes the issue by forcing the game to save your settings when you close the settings menu.


## How to use

1. Download Sybaris for COM3D2

2. Place the DLL from [releases]() into `Sybaris` folder

3. Run the game
